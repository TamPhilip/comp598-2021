Did notice an inconsistency with @realDonaldTrump not being counted, but based off of this requirements: "This means that it is separated from other alphanumeric letters by either whitespace OR non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., “antiTrump protesters” contains “trump”, but “I got trumped” does not)." it should not be counted. These are duplicates in general and those caused by retweets which causes the counting problem.
